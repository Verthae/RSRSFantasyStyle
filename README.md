This is an Editor made in the Godot Game Engine.
https://godotengine.org/download

Lacking pre-built executables currently as I'm still building the interface.
To see the current state of things, version 3.4.4 of Godot is necessary to download to open the project file.

# WIP
Still in the design phase.  
Input panel still needs to be hooked up to a data container to populate the main display.
Design decisions for input methods still being looked at.

# Plans
The goal is to be able to import custom artwork for Background, Foreground, and Character art as well as fill in the simulated in-game Style Data screen to create a preview of what the user can come up with for a vision of a Custom Character Style.
